## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose             |
|------------|---------------------|
| HTML5      | Page structure      |
| CSS3       | Styling and layout  |
| Font Awesome (optional) | Icons (e.g., cart, search) |

While building this clone, I deepened my understanding of HTML structure, CSS Flexbox, and positioning techniques. I learned how to replicate a complex real-world UI layout by analyzing existing websites and breaking them down into reusable sections. I also practiced creating responsive designs and improved my ability to build clean and organized code with reusable classes.
